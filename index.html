            <h3> Why is Learning About AI Important for Kids? </h3>

            <p> AI is all around us, and whether or not you realize it, people use artificial intelligence every single
                day.
                Even though AI is used today, computer scientists predict artificial intelligence will be even more
                prominent in the future. Because of this, many jobs will also need us to understand how AI works so we
                can
                solve big problems. This is already true of many professions today. Doctors use AI to diagnose patients
                based on medical scans, like X-rays. Astronauts can use AI models to detect exoplanets, or planets
                outside
                our Solar System. </p>
